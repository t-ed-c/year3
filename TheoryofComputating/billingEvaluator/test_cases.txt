# Basic expression with assignment
base = 100
units = 60
rate = 2.5
total = base + (units * rate)

# Ternary with discount logic
discounted = (units < 100 ? total * 0.9 : total)

# Boolean logic and penalty
isLowIncome = false
penalty = units > 100 && !isLowIncome ? 500 : 0

# Update bill with penalty
bill = total + penalty

# Function call: tariff retrieval
tariff = fetchTariff()

# Forecasting usage
forecastedBill = forecast(units)

# Edge case: division by zero
testDivide = 50 / 0
